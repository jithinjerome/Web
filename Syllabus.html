    paper.</p>
     Choosing a seminar topic: The topic for a UG seminar should be current and broad
    based rather than a very specific research work. It's advisable to choose a topic for the
    Seminar to be closely linked to the final year project area. Every member of the project
    team could choose or be assigned Seminar topics that covers various aspects linked to
    the Project area.
